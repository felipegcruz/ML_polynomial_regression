# Polynomial Regression

Polynomial Regression is a form of regression analysis used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features) by fitting a polynomial equation to the data. Unlike linear regression, which assumes a linear relationship between the variables, polynomial regression can capture non-linear relationships.

## Overview

In polynomial regression, the relationship between the independent variable x and the dependent variable y is modeled as an nth-degree polynomial function:

y = β₀ + β₁x + β₂x² + ... + βₙxⁿ + ε

where:

- y is the dependent variable (target),
- x is the independent variable (feature),
- β₀, β₁, ..., βₙ are the coefficients (parameters) of the polynomial terms,
- n is the degree of the polynomial,
- ε is the error term.

The goal of polynomial regression is to estimate the coefficients of the polynomial equation that best fits the observed data points, minimizing the difference between the actual and predicted values.

## Training Process

The training process in polynomial regression involves the following steps:

1. **Data Collection**: Gather a dataset containing observations of the independent and dependent variables.

2. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform any necessary preprocessing steps, such as handling missing values, scaling features, and splitting the dataset into training and test sets.

3. **Model Training**: Fit a polynomial regression model to the training data by estimating the coefficients of the polynomial equation using methods like least squares regression or gradient descent.

4. **Model Evaluation**: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using appropriate metrics, such as mean squared error (MSE) or R-squared (coefficient of determination), on the test set.

## Usage

Polynomial Regression can be implemented using various programming libraries, such as scikit-learn in Python. Here's a basic example of how to use Polynomial Regression with scikit-learn:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import PolynomialFeatures
from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression

# Create Polynomial Features
poly = PolynomialFeatures(degree=2)
X_poly = poly.fit_transform(X)

# Fit Polynomial Regression Model
model = LinearRegression()
model.fit(X_poly, y)

# Predict
y_pred = model.predict(X_poly)
```

## Conclusion

Polynomial Regression is a flexible and powerful technique for modeling non-linear relationships between variables. It is particularly useful when the relationship between the variables cannot be adequately captured by linear regression. However, care should be taken to avoid overfitting, especially when using higher-degree polynomials.
